I'll release my own fix here. They can not even fix their own stuff. Posers
F U BAZZITE FOR DAMAGING OUR ROG ALLYS!!!!

 Read my pdf, they promised to replace. They lied and banned me. They had also deleted my comment where I told them their fix destroyed my ALLY X! Will not turn on now.

 CROOKS!!! They don't care if you device is broken or not. It is THEIR FAULT!!

 As soon as I finish the iso, it will be here. 

 Almost done idc what they posted. They think they rule Linux. See image below for special message to those bazzite idiots!! This would had been out sooner, I do have a life.
